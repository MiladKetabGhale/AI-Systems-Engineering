# Data Science, Machine Learning Engineering, and Data Engineering Projects

Welcome to my portfolio of projects, designed to demonstrate my skills in **machine learning engineering**, **data science**, **data engineering**, and elements of **data analysis**. This repository contains standalone projects, each showcasing a specific set of capabilities, methodologies, and tools. The projects highlight the ability to build end-to-end data pipelines, engineer scalable solutions for machine learning tasks, and solve complex analytical problems.

## Repository Structure

Each project is organized into a separate folder containing all relevant code, documentation, and results. Below is a brief overview of the projects included and the upcoming ones:

### 1. Housing Price Prediction
- **Focus**: End-to-end pipeline for predicting housing prices using regression models.
- **Key Features**:
  - Automated ingestion, transformation, extraction, model training, and evaluation for house price prediction.
  - Highly configurable custom ETL logic, model selection, and evaluation metrics via configuration files.
  - Robust parsing, and dynamic data handling, error logging, and CI/CD integration
  - Scalable and extensible modular architecture for production-ready deployment

### 2. EMNIST Classification Project *(upcoming)*
- **Focus**: Tackling classification challenges on the EMNIST dataset.
- **Key Features**:
    - Statistical analysis and visualization to uncover patterns and feature relationships
    - Training, evaluation, and tunning multiple classifiers to establish performance benchmarks
    - Producing top classifer using ensemble techniuqes against classification performance metrics
    - Feature selection and parallel training to handle costly computational complexity of some models
    - Tackling class imbalance with SMOTE, class weighting, and augmentation techniques

### 3. Anomaly Detection *(upcoming in December)*
- **Focus**: Fraud detection in financial data using anomaly detection techniques.

### 4. Fully Automated Pipelined System For Anomaly Detection Using AWS, Spark, and Boto3 *(upcoming in December)*
- **Focus**: Integrating AWS services and Spark to build scalable pipelines for anomaly detection
