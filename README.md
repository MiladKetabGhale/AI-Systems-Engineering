# Portfolio of Machine Learning and Data Engineering Projects

Welcome to my portfolio of projects, designed to demonstrate my skills and expertise in **machine learning**, **data analysis**, **ML engineering**, and **data engineering**. This repository contains standalone projects, each showcasing a specific set of capabilities, methodologies, and tools. The projects highlight my ability to build end-to-end data pipelines, engineer scalable solutions, and solve complex analytical problems.

## Repository Structure

Each project is organized into a separate folder containing all relevant code, documentation, and results. Below is a brief overview of the projects included and the upcoming ones:

### 1. Housing Price Prediction
- **Focus**: End-to-end pipeline for predicting housing prices using regression models.
