# Data Science, Machine Learning Engineering, and Data Engineering Projects

Welcome to my portfolio of projects, designed to demonstrate my skills in **machine learning engineering**, **data science**, **data engineering**, and elements of **data analysis**. This repository contains standalone projects, each showcasing a specific set of capabilities, methodologies, and tools. The projects highlight the ability to build end-to-end data pipelines, engineer scalable solutions for machine learning tasks, and solve complex analytical problems.

## Repository Structure

Each project is organized into a separate folder containing all relevant code, documentation, and results. Below is a brief overview of the projects included and the upcoming ones:

### 1. Housing Price Prediction
- **Focus**: End-to-end pipeline for predicting housing prices using regression models.
- **Key Features**:
  - Automated ingestion, transformation, extraction, model training, and evaluation for house price prediction.
  - Highly configurable custom ETL logic, model selection, and evaluation metrics via configuration files.
  - Robust parsing, and dynamic data handling, error logging, and CI/CD integration
  - Scalable and extensible modular architecture for production-ready deployment

### 2. EMNIST Classification Project
- **Focus**: Tackling classification challenges on the EMNIST dataset.
- **Key Features**:
    - Statistical analysis and visualization to uncover patterns and feature relationships
    - Training, evaluation, and tunning multiple classifiers to establish performance benchmarks
    - thorough error analysis including tools such as SHAP and Barier scores. Detailed timing analysis for model training
    - Producing top classifer using ensemble techniuqes against classification performance metrics
    - Feature selection and parallel training to handle costly computational complexity of some models
    - Tackling class imbalance with SMOTE, class weighting, and augmentation techniques

### 3. Fully Automated Pipelined System For Anomaly Detection Using AWS, Spark, and Boto3 *(upcoming in January)*
- **Focus**: Integrating AWS services with Spark using Botot3 to build scalable, automated pipelines for anomaly detection

### 4. Survival Analysis Using Healthcare Dataset *(upcoming in February)*
- **Focus**: Focuses on use of advanced statistical analysis frameworks and tools in combination with real and synthetic healthcare data for survival analysis.
